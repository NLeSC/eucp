= EUCP Notebook

A notebook and data sharing system for climate research.

This document is work in progress.

Last update: 15-3-2019


== Goals

This repository contains and documents the infrastructure for a notebook and data sharing system for use within the European Climate Prediction (EUCP) project, a Horizon 2020 project.

The notebook system allows scientists to use a uniform interface to perform their analysis on climate data sets.
It runs on the same server where the data is stored, or very close to a data server, removing the need to download the required data sets locally.
Data access should also be easy, and fast.
The use of notebooks also allows easier sharing of analyses, for example with peers (direct collaborators, referees etc.) and a more general audience.
In addition, the analysis steps are to be saved (including history versioning) for reproducibility.

== Setup

For an overview of the architecture and configuration used, see the link:docs/README.adoc[docs directory].

An introduction to Jupyter can be found in the link:docs/tutorial[tutorial section], while examples notebooks are available in the link:examples/[examples directory].

The details of the setup can be found in the link:ansible/[Ansible directory].
The Ansible playbook is used to configure the server.
The details of the Docker image can be found in the link:docker/[Docker directory].

== Resources

The server and storage is hosted at the SURFsara (NLeSC partner) data center.
The total amount of data storage available is (currently) 40 TB, and will be 100 TB later in the project.
This includes the need for scratch space for individual users during analysis runs.

The current setup is a Ubuntu virtual machine (VM), with eight cores.

The storage uses CEPH datablocks.
These will be made persistent, so that scratch space will persist between restarts of the VM.
The home directories of the users will also be saved.
These directories, however, should *not* be used or seen as a place for permanent storage: scripts and notebooks should be stored elsewhere, for example in (private) repositories.

Some details about the system used can be found at https://doc.hpccloud.surfsara.nl[SURFsara HPC cloud documentation].

Requires a GitHub account to sign in.
Provides a JupyterLab environment for geoscience.
It allows to run multi-core processes using `dask` and `xarray` on a cloud system: this will fire off separate "pods" for the computation.

This appears to be one of the few (only?) similar project that has its source code fully available, with an installation description.

WEkEO appears to target a very broad audience, and many possibilities (including virtual machines and notebooks).
It is currently in testing mode, with a possibility for free trial.
It is unclear which data is stored directly next to the analyses server or virtual machines.

Looks to be very similar in purpose to this project: a Jupyter notebook/lab environment next to datasets
Uses Ophidia as a terminal interface, instead of the standard terminal.

Has its own version of a notebook, which appears less flexible and extendable compared to a standard JupyterHub + Lab environment.
